# Advent of Code

Projects that I have worked on from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website.

These have been fun at keeping me in practice (though it's obviously not spread
across all of software engineering). I usually have focused on a new
programming language for each year I've tackled.

In rough order, these are the years I've worked on, in order:

* 2023: Language: [Perl](https://www.perl.org/). This was my first year and I
  even managed to place 999 (which will never happen again that I finish in the
  top 1,000 but it was nice to see it happen my first go through). I used
  [C++](https://isocpp.org/) here and there as well, especially where
  performance would help me avoid actually learning the concept they wanted me
  to get :P.
* 2015: Language: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). I've long liked Ruby
  as a "Perl with less warts". I had decided to start on AoC puzzles from the
  beginning, even during the 2023 advent while I was waiting for the next
  puzzle to drop.
* 2024: Language: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I had started with Perl
  but decided early on to use this as a good forcing function to learn
  something new. And what better than the New Hotness? (Don't be fooled by my
  being trite, Rust lived up to a good deal of the hype in my experience here
  and I barely scratched its surface).
* 2019: Language:
  [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). I
  heard enough good things about the Intcode puzzles this year that I skipped
  from 2015 to 2019. For JavaScript I was first using
  [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) as a relatively easy-to-use host but
  ended up switching to [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) after one-to-many bug or
  implementation gap. Turned out Node was no trouble to use even for small
  scripts.
